# Airbnb Clone

## Introduction
Airbnb Clone Web Application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, structured with an MVC architecture for clean and organized code.

## Features
**1. Homepage Functionalities:**
- **Filters & Search:** Allows users to easily find accommodations that meet their criteria.

- **Delete:** Users can delete their accommodations or reviews, with associated data (e.g., images) removed from Cloudinary.

**4. MVC Structure:**
- **Models:** Defined data schemas for accommodations, users, and reviews using Mongoose.
- **Views:** Created reusable templates with EJS.
- **Controllers:** Modularized application logic for better scalability and maintainability.
